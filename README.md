# LadyBRG

Hello!

This is a quick prototype I created for the [Gamedev.js Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2025) using **[Phaser](https://phaser.io/)**.

The theme for the jam was **balance**. When I thought about balance, I immediately connected it with **color mixing**. I had several ideas around this concept, but most of them ended up being too complicated or hard to understand at first glance.

Eventually, I landed on the idea of using the [**HUE color wheel**](https://colourliteracy.org/colour-wheel-hue-circle) as a way to visualize color mixing. This allowed me to focus only on **hue/tone**, and skip **lightness** and **saturation**, which tend to make things more complex.

For me, mixing colors made more sense as finding the **midpoint** between two hues on the circle. So, the goal of the game is to reach a **target color** starting from a different point on the hue wheel by **adding** or **subtracting** hues.  
I know that's not how color works in real life, but I think it makes things easier and more intuitive for a game.

## How to Play

Your task is to pick the arrow (representing a color) that you believe, when added or subtracted to your current hue, will bring you closer to the target hue.  
Most of the time, the best choice is the one that gets you **halfway between your current color and the target**.

The ladybug will move around the color wheel in the chosen direction toward the selected color, and stop **midway** between the current hue and the chosen one. Your goal is to land exactly on the target color!
